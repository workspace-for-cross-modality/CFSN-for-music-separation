# Cycle-Refining Network (CRN) for Visually-guided Music Source Separation
This project is to dispaly the supplementary materials for our work "Cycle-Refining Network (CRN) for Visually-guided Music Source Separation".

The supplementary materials are divided into two parts: the code part and the multimedia files of our separation results. 

## Code Part
The README of our code can be seen at /code/CRN/README.md.

## Music Multimedia Results
The multimedia results include three sub-parts: artificial 2-mix samples, artificial 3-mix samples, and real-mix duet samples. 
For each sample, we present the files: 
* mixture music files
* separation music files
* ground truth music files
* object image files that corresponding to sound sources
* the spectrograms for every music files.
